# **C-Simple Shell**
Welcome to our C simple shell project! Our project is a collaboration between two individuals who are passionate about learning and exploring the inner workings of operating systems.

Our goal with this project is to develop a basic command-line interface program in C language that interprets and executes commands entered by the user. We aim to design and implement a shell that is capable of parsing input commands into arguments, executing them, and providing output to the user.

Throughout the project, we worked together to define the features and functionality of the shell, break down the work into smaller tasks, and assign responsibilities for each task. We collaborated to develop and test the code, ensuring that it meets the project requirements and works correctly.

Our simple shell supports basic commands such as cd, ls, pwd, echo, and exit, as well as command-line arguments and error handling. We also explored more advanced features such as handling signals, implementing pipelines, and supporting background processes.

We hope that this project will serve as a learning experience for us and for anyone else who is interested in learning more about operating systems and C programming. Please feel free to provide us with feedback or suggestions for improvement. Thank you for checking out our project!
